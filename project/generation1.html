            <p>
                The first generation began in 1965 and ended in 1973. The orignial Mustang was derived from the 1960 Ford Falcon compact. It was made public at the New York World's Fair. 
                The intial model included a two body style car that came in either a hardtop or convertible. Newer models in 1969 changes the body design and introduced new trim and performance packages.            </p>
            <p>
                The first generation Mustang consisted of a 2.8-liter straight-siz engine and a 4.3-liter V8 enginer with 164-horsepower. These engines were upgraded before the 
                traditional opening of the new model year. The 1967 model year had a changed Fastback body style and the 1968 version was made to appear in the Steven McQueens famous move.
