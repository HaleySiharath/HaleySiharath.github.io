                                Mustang Feens was founded by Seth Lamay in 2022. Lamay has always been a Ford Mustang "feen" but after the 
                                restoration of his 2006 Ford Mustang GT, he truly fell in love. His passion inspired him to create the Mustang Feens 
                                site as he wants to share his passion with other Mustang lovers!

                                        The Ford Mustang was first on the market on April 17, 1964 at the price of $2,368. The car was instanly a hit with over 20,000 Mustangs being ordered on the first day alone. After being featured on the track 
                                        for the 1964 Indianapolis 500, the popularity of Mustangs only grew. Over the years, the sporty coupe became the "it" car as it was increasingly being featured on 
                                        films, commerical advertisements, and posters.

                                        A large apeal to the Mustang is not only it's sleek style or it's performance abilities but the fact that it is an American made car. Overtime, mustangs have gone over 
                                        an array of changes from generation to generation. Wether it be changes to the engine, such as in the sixth generation, or a redesign of the body, like the thrid generation.

                                        The original team for the Ford Mustang consisted of executive stylist John Najjar, Ford stylist Philip T. Clark, and Ford Division market research 
                                        manager Robert J. Eggert. Although these people had many teams working on the creation of Mustang, their work is to be appriceated for what the Mustang has become today.
