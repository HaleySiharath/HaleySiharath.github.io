            <h3>Page Design</h3>

            <p>
                The following information will go into brief detail into which each page will contain
            </p>

            <h4>Home Page</h4>
            <p class = "sub-content">
                This serves as the landing page for the website. This page should be intriguing to the user
                to incentivize them to stay for a while. It also gives the user a basic understanding of 
                what the site will provide.
            </p>
            <p class = "sub-content">
                The content contained on this page will consist of a brief overview paragraph at the top of the page 
                followed by a timeline that works from top to bottom displaying text and a picture to coincide with it.
                The images of the timeline will be sorted on different sides of the page (left to right) in order to make 
                the overall design more appealing.
            </p>

            <ul class = "sub-content">
                <li>Will the page ask for users to enter data? Will they need validated?</li>
                <li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>No</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Will the page contain buttons or hyperlinks or dropdowns?</li>
                <li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Yes, hyperlinks to other pages</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>What actions will happen on the page?</li>
                <li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Hyperlink to other pages through the use of images and links</li>
                        <li>Animation of images moving with the scroll feature</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Generation Content Pages</h4>
            <p class = "sub-content">
                There is six generations of Ford Mustangs that will be disscussed throughout the site and 
                each of these pages contain similar layout. Namely, the content is what will be changing throughout 
                each page. Therefore, the design of these six pages will follow the following design criteria.
            </p>
            <p class = "sub-content">
                The content on these pages will contain multiple images displayed in a slide show. There will be history facts 
                sorted throughout the page and basic information on current selling price for a specific model. There will also 
                be ways to learn more about the vehicles by outsourcing links to other sites with seller/buyer information.
            </p>

            <ul class = "sub-content">
                <li>Will the page ask for users to enter data? Will they need validated?</li>
                <li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>No</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Will the page contain buttons or hyperlinks or dropdowns?</li>
                <li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Yes, the navbar</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>What actions will happen on the page?</li>
                <li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The navbar is included on all these pages but they maintain static</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Dynamic Functionality</h3>
            <p>
                Due to the nature of the page, there is not much dynamic functionality to the page 
                aside from a subscribe form and animation of images. The subscription feature 
                will be a simple form seen on many sites, especially news sites, to have frequent users 
                get daily updates and content from the site. The animation of images will dynamically change 
                the page but the coding for it will be executed in CSS.
            </p>
