                        <b>STORY/ITEM:</b> About 5 years ago I spent a good $30 or so dollars on a claw machine to collect some random pinky-sized squishy characters. I was so determined to get them because I had this great idea of gluing them onto my wall and having them be my little wall pets. Needless to say, I never went through with the idea and all 12 of those little creatures lay underneath my desk in a ziplock bag to this day.
