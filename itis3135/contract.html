            <h2>Contract</h2>

            <!--content of the page-->
            <p>I, <a href = "./introduction.html">Haley V. Siharath</a> agree to abide by the terms of the course contract 
                in my Spring 2022, ITIS 3135 with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.
            </p>

            <p>
                I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world, and 
                will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
            </p>

            <p>
                I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, 
                failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
            </p>

            <p>
                I also understand that given the structure and content of this class it’s possible to find many examples online 
                or even view my classmates’ code directly. I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and will not 
                cut and paste code except where i have properly given credit (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates.
            </p>

            <p>
