            <h3>What is CRAP?</h3>
            <p>
                The principles of design, CRAP, is an extrodinary tool used by graphic designers to create designers
                that reels in consumer/readers. CRAP stands for contrast, repetition, alignment, proximity. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>Contrast</span> refers to both text size and color of the design, it allows the reader to easily read and navigate
                the page. <span>Repetition</span> is used in design to keep a theme ongoing. It also unifies a design making it ideal
                for branding. <span>Alignment</span> is the lines that run through the work. This can be text alignment or the placement
                of pictures. Proper alignment will help avoid the creation of a confusing mumble jumble design. The last 
                design principle, <span>proximity</span>, breaks up the content of a design to allow for the consumer/reader to easily 
                skim the information off of the deisgn.
            </p>
            <p>
                Below is a good and bad website example of the CRAP principles.
