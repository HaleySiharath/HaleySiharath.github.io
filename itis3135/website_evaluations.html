            <h3>What is CRAP?</h3>
            <p>
                The principles of design, CRAP, is an extrodinary tool used by graphic designers to create designers
                that reels in consumer/readers. CRAP stands for contrast, repetition, alignment, proximity. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>Contrast</span> refers to both text size and color of the design. Proper contrast allows easy navigation 
                and reading of a page's content. <span>Repetition</span> is used in design to keep a theme ongoing. 
                It also unifies a design making it ideal for branding. <span>Alignment</span> is the lines that run through 
                the work. This can be text alignment or the placement of pictures. Proper alignment will help avoid the 
                creation of a confusing mumble-jumble design. The last  design principle, <span>proximity</span>, breaks 
                up the content of a design to allow for the consumer/reader to easily skim the information off of the design.
            </p>
            <p>
                Below is websites with good and bad use of CRAP design principles.

                <p>
                    Gloablance World is a service that aids in creating, comparing, and evaluationg portfolios. The company 
                    opens their page with a brief summary of their service and then list the features of the service.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>Contrast</span>:
                        <p>
                            The website uses a bright yellow and black. The shades and usage of these colors create a 
                            high contrast, but is not overbearing. The website also uses nuetral colors such as grey to 
                            balance out and seperate the content within the page.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><span>Repetition</span>:
                        <p>
                            There is clear repetition through out the page from the font to the color. The structuring of the 
                            listed features also follows an alternating pattern of pictures and text that makes it appealing and 
                            intriguing to read.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><span>Alignment</span>:
                        <p>
                            All content within the main tag has a large margin on both right and left side that allows the content 
                            to be centered. There is also clear visible spaces between content that makes sharp and clean vertical lines. 
                            Everything in the header and footer is also formated and aligned consistently with proper spacing.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><span>Proximity</span>:
                        <p>
                            The page has a great use of white space that properly seperates images, icons, and text. Specificaly, 
                            the paragraphs are easily broken up and placed closed to relating content. There is no confusion as to 
                            what information goes whith which graphics due to the use of proper placement.
                        </p>

                <h3><a href = "https://www.bobsaget.com/"> Bad CRAP Design</a></h3>
                <p>
                    Bob Saget's webpage is used to advertise his movies, books, and upcomming tour. The website 
                    seems to be divided into three different section. The first being an "introduction" to 
                    Bob Saget and what he has to offer. The second section contains more information about his 
                    current tour. The last section displays a couple of reviews of his past tours/shows.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>Contrast</span>: 
                        <p>
                            The overall color scheme works well together, however, the use of grey buttons ontop of a grey background 
                            or white text over a white background makes it hard to use the website. There is poor planning 
                            of elements and how they appear on the background, by selecting a couple more colors this issue can be resolved.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><span>Repetition</span>:
                        <p>
                            There are few repeating elements carried throughout this page. The font is kept consistent throughout, but 
                            the repeating elements created are often broken throughout the website. For instance, the first section 
                            has the elements filling the whole screen whereas the later sections are organized into asymetrical boxes.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><span>Alignment</span>:
                        <p>
                            The alignment of the later sections of the page takes on a asymetrical design but it works for the website. 
                            This theme is broken in the first section where there are not many consistent lines and things dont line up. 
                            For instance, the navigation buttons at the top are not horizontally aligned.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><span>Proximity</span>:
                        <p>
                            The buttons and logo on the page are pushed to the edge of the screen with no apparent reason. There is also 
                            uncessicary gaps between buttons, images, and text. This makes an unbalanced page of content and empty white 
                            spaces.
                        </p>
